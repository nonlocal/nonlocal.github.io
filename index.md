Hello and welcome to this blog. 

I am [@nonlocal](https://github.com/nonlocal/) and [@psds01](https://github.com/psds01). I have had mutliple titles so far: **Data Scientist**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, **Senior Data Scientist**, **NLP Engineer**, etc.

I describe myself as someone who works with data and creates solutions that businesses use. For that purpose, I often employ:
1. Software engineering
2. Simple/advanced statistical analysis to know more about the data at hand and act on it
3. Rule based systems to automated frequent/mundate patterns
4. Machine learning or deep learning systems to solve complex problems
