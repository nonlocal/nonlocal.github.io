## Questions:
How meaning is generated from word occurence statistics?

Local and global corpus statistics?

## Notation

$X$ : Co-occurrence matrix of words

$X_{ij}$ : number of times word j occurs in the context of word i.

$X_{i} = \sum_{k}X_{ik}$ be the number of times any word appears in the context of word $i$.

$P_{ij}=P(i \mid j)=X_{ij}/X_{i}$ be the probability that word $j$ appears in the context of word $i$.


## How meaning can be extracted from cooccurrences
